# Business Analytics in Finance: Identifying Profitability and Cost Efficiency for Superstore 

## Business Context  
Superstore is a retail business operating across multiple regions in the United States. Although revenue has grown steadily between 2014 and 2017, management has expressed concerns about fluctuating profitability and rising costs in some areas of the business. Stakeholders require a clear understanding of which regions, products, and customer segments drive profits, and where inefficiencies limit growth. This project addresses these business requirements through a structured data analysis process.  

## Business Requirements  
Stakeholders defined the following requirements for the analysis:  
- Measure overall revenue, profit, profit margin, and cost-to-revenue ratio across 2014–2017.  
- Identify which regions contribute most and least to profit.  
- Evaluate operational efficiency by comparing cost-to-revenue ratios across regions.  
- Understand seasonal or monthly fluctuations in profit and detect outliers.  
- Analyze product categories to determine which drive profits and which erode them.  
- Assess customer segments to identify which group delivers the lion’s share of profits.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve profitability and cost efficiency.  

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
- Total Revenue: $2.30M (2014–2017)  
- Total Profit: $286.40K  
- Profit Margin: 12%  
- Cost-to-Revenue Ratio: 88%  
- Revenue Growth: 47% over the four-year period  

## Data Collection  
The dataset was sourced from the Global Superstore dataset on Kaggle, covering sales transactions from 2014 to 2017. It contains details on orders, sales, profit, customer segments, product categories, and regions.

## Tools and Approach  
- Python was used for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and KPI calculations.  
- Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards with slicers for Year, Region, and Product Category, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific areas of interest.  
- The dashboard highlights profitability trends, cost-to-revenue efficiency, and customer segment contributions.  
- GitHub is used to document and showcase the project.  

## Key Insights  
- Regional Performance: The West generated the highest profit at $108K, while the Central region lagged behind with only $40K due to higher costs.  
- Cost Efficiency: Regions with lower cost-to-revenue ratios (West 85%, South 88%) retained more profit. Central had the highest ratio at 92%, leaving little room for margins.  
- Seasonality: Profits peaked in November and December each year, with December 2016 recording the highest monthly profit at $17.9K. However, some months such as July 2014 and January 2015 made losses (-$0.88K and -$3.3K respectively).
- Product Categories: Office Supplies and Technology were the most efficient categories, each with cost-to-revenue ratios around 83%. Furniture underperformed, generating $0.74M in sales but only $0.02M in profit.  
- Customer Segments: Consumers delivered the largest share of profit at 47% ($138.12K), followed by Corporate at 32% and Home Office at 21%.  

## Recommendations  
- Prioritize expansion in the West and East regions, where profits are higher and operations run more smoothly, while conducting a detailed review of staff, supply chain, and overhead costs in the Central and South regions to identify specific areas to reduce expenses.
- Address inefficiencies in the Furniture category by reviewing pricing, discounting and sourcing strategies.  
- Leverage seasonality by increasing marketing campaigns and inventory during November and December.  
- Strengthen Corporate relationships for stable profitability and introduce loyalty strategies to retain Consumer customers.  
- Continuously monitor cost-to-revenue ratios, as small reductions in costs can significantly improve margins.
